# ✨ API Hub ✨

So I use a lot of free and open API's all the time for random apps, experiments and even production ready apps. And time after time I have to relearn their end-points, parameters, query formats and dig through their documentations and more so I can understand their responses and convert them all into suitable formats and that has been tiring. 😵

So I decided to make APIHub, a parent API to all other APIs. I don't have to relearn end-points, dig through their documentations, convert responses to **JSON** and go through the hassle anymore. I only have to learn this one API and that's it! 🥳

## Best Features
* Not only does it handle basic requests but it also handles nested requests **automatically.** So your frontend only has to request once, whole the API handles all nested requests and responds with a complete response 
* It extends query parameters. It goes further than the basic API usage provided; it handles calculations, date conversions, response limits, data filters, date ranges and so much more. 
* All responses are JSON and It's got a predictable error response and handling.
